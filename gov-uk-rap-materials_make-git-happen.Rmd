## What is git?

"You use Git to take snapshots of all the files in a folder."

<div class="notes">
  git is a version control tool. It is a way of keeping track of:
  
  - How are files are changing
  - Who is making those changes
  - When were the changes made
  - Why were the changes made
</div>

## Snapshots in time

<p class="aligncenter">

<div class="notes">
  On the left, we have a typical file version tracking systems. We create new files and include dates and flags to denote changes that were made. With this we quickly lose track of different versions of our files and we end up with a cluttered file system.
  
  On the right, we have the same file but monitored by git. It remains a single file throughout but git has recorded how, when, why and who has made what changes to the document. We can easily track back through how the document has changed.

<div class="notes">
  Here, we can see version control in action for this presentation. Recording what changes I have made, when I made them, and why I made them. And I can jump back to anyone of these older versions of my file.
</div>

## Three key concepts

<img src="images/VersionControl_vertical.png" width="15%" height="auto" align="right">

<br>

- **Repository** - your project folder
- **Commit** - a snapshot of your folder
- **Branch** - a working version of your folder

<div class="notes">
  There are three key concepts to version control:

  1. Repository - this is the same as a folder on our computer. It's the place we keep all teh files we need for a particular project.
  2. Commit - this is how we tell git that we have made some changes we'd like it to record
  3. Branch - we can think of branches as a copy of our folder that we are currently working on for a particular task. Once we have completed the work we'll merge any changes back into the main copy of the repository.
</div>

## Three key concepts

<img src="images/VersionControl_vertical.png" width="15%" height="auto" align="right">

<br>

- **Repository** - your project folder
- **Commit** - a snapshot of your folder
  * We use `push` to send the snapshots online
  * And `pull` to retrieve an updated snapshot
- **Branch** - a working version of your folder

## Installing `git`

<img src="images/logos/git_logo.png" width="40%" height="auto" align="right">

<br>

- For Windows, download the executable [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- On a mac type `git --version` in your terminal
- On linux machines type `sudo apt install git-all` in your terminal

<br>

_Note that you may need admin rights on your computer, without these you'll need to request an install._

## Create a GitHub account

<img src="images/logos/github_logo_octo.png" width="35%" height="auto" align="right">

<br>

GitHub offers a range of account types. A free account is available for organisations and individuals.

Even if you're in an institution, create a personal GitHub account to keep track of you own work.

You'll find more information, and links for creating an account, [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

## Create a repository

- Follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) to create your first repository
- Some key files to include:

  `README` - ideally format this as a markdown `md` file (more info [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes) and [here](https://github.com/18F/open-source-guide/blob/18f-pages/pages/making-readmes-readable.md))<br>
  
  `LICENSE` - how you want people to re-use your code ([info](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository))<br>
  
  `.gitignore` - names of any files in your project you don't want on GitHub ([templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/README.md))<br>
  
<p class="aligncenter">

## Managing your repository in the command line

<img src="images/logos/git_logo.jpg" width="35%" height="auto" align="right">

- `git` is traditionally a command line tool
- Use these commands to navigate between folders in the command line:
  * `cd path/to/new/folder/` - use `cd` to move between folders (remember that "`..`" means go back one folder)
  * `ls` - to list the files and folders in your current folder (`dir` in Windows)
- Here's some more help for [Windows](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands/), [mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/mac-terminal-commands-cheat-sheet/), and [linux](https://www.hostinger.co.uk/tutorials/linux-commands) users
- Once you're happy with the above commands, here are some screenshots to illustrate using the command line to setup `git`
