## What is a Analytical Pipeline? The ideal scenario

<br><br>

<p class="aligncenter">
    <img src="images/TraditionalAnalysis-Aim.png" width="85%" height="auto" align="center">
</p>

<div class="notes">
Our ideal analytical pipeline has a clear set of steps that we do once in succession to create a final report.

Here, we:

1. Download some data and store it in an excel file, which we create a formatted table within
2. We load the excel data into R to generate a chart
3. We then copy and paste the formatted table and chart into a word document and add some text and formatting to create the final report
</div>

## What is a Analytical Pipeline? The reality...

<p class="aligncenter">
    <img src="images/TraditionalAnalysis-Reality.png" width="85%" height="auto" align="center">
</p>

## What are the issues?

<img src="images/TraditionalMess.png" width="50%" height="auto" align="right">

<br>

- Lots of manual steps
- Hard to reproduce
- Mistakes are easily made and hard to track
- The steps aren't recorded
- Using multiple independent tools
- How do we keep track of which file versions people have?

## What is a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)?

<br><br>

- It is easily repeatable
- It is easily extendable
- It is automated
- It minimises mistakes
- It is fast
- It builds trust

<br>

- Easy for others to use
- Others can change and adapt
- All steps are recorded
  - Including whilst it is built
- Automated and fast
- Open and promotes trust

## Is it Data Science?

<img src="images/BuildingBlock_datascience.png" width="100%" height="auto" align="center">

No, it is a building block that's essential for data science!

## What do we need?

- Open-source tools
- Version control with `git`
- To consider reproducibility
- Time to learn

<a href="https://git-scm.com/"> <img src="images/logos/git_logo.jpg" width="15%" height="auto"> </a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://rstudio.com/"> <img src="images/logos/RStudio_logo.png" width="15%" height="auto"> </a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.python.org/"> <img src="images/logos/Python_logo.svg" width="15%" height="auto"> </a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.java.com/en/"> <img src="images/logos/Java_logo.png" width="15%" height="auto"> </a>

  
## Why open-source instead of proprietary?

<a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction"> <img src="images/DecolonisingKnowledge.jpg" width="50%" height="auto" align="right" alt="Source: The Turing Way"> </a>

<br>

Open source tools are:

- Used by millions - huge supportive online community
- Flexible to all data sources
- Free for anyone to use - it is easier to share
- Flexible to all output types

## What is version control?

Tracking the three **W**s: **W**ho made **W**hich change and **W**hy? <br><br>

<img src="images/VersionControl_explained.png" width="100%" height="auto" align="center">


## For example, take a look at this [presentation](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/gov-uk-rap-materials)

<img src="images/MyVersionHistory.png" width="80%" height="auto" align="center">


## Why use version control?

<img src="images/logos/git_logo.png" width="40%" height="auto" align="right">

<br>

- One place to store your code
- You and collaborators are free to write and develop locally
- Complete documented history of all changes made
- Easy to share
- Your future self will thank you! 

## Which version control should I use?

| Tool                                                              | Cost   | Where is master? | Advantage              | Disadvantage
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------- | -----------------------|
| [Github](https://github.com/)                                     | Free   | Online           | Huge user base         | \$\$\$ for private repositories 
| [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)                               | Free   | Local or Online  | Continuous integration | Smaller user base
| [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)                               | \$\$\$ | Cloud            | Cloud security         | Harder to share
| [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/repos/) | \$\$\$ | Cloud            | Cloud security         | Harder to share

## What do we mean by reproducible?

<br>

We want to look back and be able to repeat our work easily and quickly.

What are the benefits?

- Helps build trust
- Not reliant on single individual
- Can be adapted and re-used

## Making a RAP is difficult

Before we start, here are a few things to consider:

- IT infrastructure available
- Data privacy - where and how am I storing my data?
- Expertise - what training do I need?
- Legacy systems - what are the barriers to transitioning?

## But it is worth it!

<p class="aligncenter">

## And we don't have to do it all at once

<br><br>
<img src="images/BuildingBlock_rap.png" width="60%" height="auto" align="right">

The building blocks of a RAP:

- Version control
- Using open-source tools
- Create reproducible code

<br>

\... are useful in their own right, each will improve the auditability, speed and quality of your work.

## RAP in practice

<img src="images/RAP-project-wordcloud.png" width="50%" height="auto" align="right">

<br><br>

RAP has been successfully rolled out in 10s of projects across the UK government.

It is now part of the best practice [documentation](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/quality-statistics-in-government/#reproducible-analytical-pipelines-rap-).

Work continues across the government to roll out RAP to more projects.

## Packages to help us with RAP

<a href="https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/govdown/"> <img src="images/GovdownScreenshot.png" width="45%" height="auto" align="right"> </a>

`govdown` - R [package](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/govdown/) to recreate our UK government website template.

`drake` - R [package](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/drake-intro/#1) to streamline reproducible pipelines in R.

`snapcraft` - python [package](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-overview) to solve those dependency issues!

## Mentorship at the Data Science Campus

<br>

<a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/"> <img src="images/Mentorship.png" width="35%" height="auto" align="right"> </a>

We aim to raise the aid community's capacity for using Data Science to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.

We'll link up Data Scientist mentors from the campus with mentees. Together we'll set plan out a project, describing:

- What the project is, its impact and scope
- The resources, expertise and time will we'll need
- And, how we'll work together during the project

<br>

<a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/"> <img src="images/Mentorship.png" width="35%" height="auto" align="right"> </a>

As we plan out our project, we'll be considering those sometimes difficult aspects of RAP:

- IT infrastructure available
- Data privacy - where and how am I storing my data?
- Expertise - what training do I need?
- Legacy systems - what are the barriers to transitioning?
