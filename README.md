# Reproducible Analytical Pipeline learning materials

A collection of documents describing what a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline is and why it is useful. We will continue to add resources to this repository as we create them.

> A Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) brings together code and data to generate outputs. The RAP pipeline is built within a version control system (e.g. `git`) to create a transparent production process.
