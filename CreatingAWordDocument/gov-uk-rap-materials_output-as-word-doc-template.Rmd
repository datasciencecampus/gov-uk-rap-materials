To create title page:
- I modified styles for title, subtitle, Author, and Date
  * I opened the word document produced by R
  * Home -> styles gallery -> click tiny expand in bottom right corner
  
To have page breaks:
- I modified the Header 9:
  * Home -> styles gallery -> click tiny expand in bottom right corner
  * Select Header 9 and edit paragraph settings to insert page break
  * Set font size to as small as possible and colour to white - so it isn't seen!
- Then used 9 hashes (#########) to link to this header in Rmarkdown and this will create line break

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
